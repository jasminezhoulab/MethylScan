# MethylScan codes

## Overview

This code is the implementation of five tasks: (1) multi-cancer detection and localization in the general population, (2) liver cancer surveillance in high-risk individuals, (3) liver disease classification, (4) race prediction, and (5) tissue deconvolution for identification of organ abnormalities.

The first four tasks use Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifier with the L2 penalty and default hyperparameter C=1 for binary classification (Tasks 1) or multi-class classification. The last task (tissue deconvolution) used the optimization process using R package `limSolve`.

## Prerequisite Packages

This code requires the following R packages:

1) dplyr
2) caret
3) rsample
4) limSolve
5) RhpcBLASctl
6) limma

## Usage

### Inputs
